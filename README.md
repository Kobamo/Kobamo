Hi, I am Kobamo Nelton Nnoka from Botswana and I hold a double major degree in economics and statistics from the University of Botswana. 
I am here to expand my skillset with regards to all things computing and programming. 
My interests lie in the areas of data analytics and machine learning.
Looking forward to learning from you and hopefully contribute meaningfully too!!
